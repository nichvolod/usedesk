You are agreeing to be bound by these Terms of Service. If you do not agree to these Terms of Service, please do not use the Usedesk Service. In these Terms of Service, "you" refers both to you as an individual and to the entity you represent. If you violate any of these Terms of Service, we reserve the right to cancel your account or block access to your account without notice.

Restrictions. You may not use the Usedesk Service for any illegal or unauthorized purpose. You must not, in the use of the Usedesk Service, violate any laws in your jurisdiction, including, among other things, by:

deliberately misleading anyone as to your identity, impersonating another, or falsely identifying the source of any information.

### Payment, Refunds, Upgrading and Downgrading

A valid credit card is required for paying accounts unless your company pays for services annually, in which case payment via invoice is acceptable. Free accounts are not required to provide a credit card number.

The Usedesk Service is billed in advance in accordance with our pricing schedule. If you are unhappy with the Usedesk Service for any reason and choose to downgrade or cancel, we will refund up to two months of charges to your account. There will be no refunds or credits for partial months of service, annual payments, or refunds for months unused with an open account. In order to treat everyone equally, no exceptions will be made.

All fees are exclusive of all taxes, levies, or duties imposed by taxing authorities, and you will be responsible for payment of all such taxes, levies, or duties, excluding only United States (federal or state) income taxes. You agree to pay for any taxes that might be applicable to your use of the Usedesk Service or payments made by you in connection with your use of the Usedesk Service.

### Violation of these Terms of Service

We reserve the right to investigate and prosecute violations of any of these Terms of Service to the fullest extent of the law. We may involve and cooperate with law enforcement authorities in prosecuting Users who violate the Terms of Service. You acknowledge that Usedesk has no obligation to prescreen or monitor your access to or use of the Usedesk Service or any information, materials or other content provided or made available through the Usedesk Service, but has the right to do so. You hereby agree that Usedesk may, in the exercise of our sole discretion, remove or delete any data, accounts or other content that violates these Terms of Service or that is otherwise objectionable. Cancellation

You are solely responsible for properly canceling your account. As a security precaution, an email or phone request to cancel or make changes to your account will not result in cancellation. You can cancel your account at any time from the "Your Plan" page. The Account Owner, and in some cases Administrators with permission, are the only Users with access to this page.

Any cancellation of your account will result in the deactivation or deletion of your account, and the removal of all content in your account. This information can be restored by request of the Account Owner to Usedesk for a 14-day period. Cancelled accounts cannot be recovered or restored from Usedesk following this 14-day period. Please be aware that we may for a time retain residual account information in our backup and/or archival copies of our database. We will make reasonable commercial efforts to delete your information as soon as possible after you communicate that intention to us.

Cancellations will take effect immediately. If you wish to continue using your account through the end of a billing cycle, please do not cancel until the billing cycle is completed. Termination

Usedesk reserves the right to terminate any free accounts that do not have any activity (replies or logins) for sixty (60) days, or trial accounts without a payment method thirty (30) days after expiration.

Usedesk, in its sole discretion, has the right to suspend or terminate your account if you breach these Terms of Service. Any termination of your account will result in the deactivation or deletion of your account, denied access to your account, and the removal of all content in your account. Modifications to the Usedesk Site and Prices

We reserve the right at any time and from time to time to modify or discontinue, temporarily or permanently, the Usedesk Service (or any part thereof) with or without notice. However, we will make our very best efforts to notify customers of any upcoming system maintenance and/or service disruptions. Prices of all Usedesk Service plans are subject to change. If Usedesk does for any reason have to remove the plan you are on or require an upgrade to a current plan, we will provide you with at least three (3) months notice via email.

We will not be liable to you or to any third party for any modification, price change, suspension or discontinuance of the Usedesk Service.

We reserve the right, in our sole discretion, to change, modify, add to, supplement or delete any portion of these Terms of Service at any time, effective with or without prior notice; provided, however, that we will use reasonable efforts to provide you with notification of any material changes (as determined in our sole discretion) by email.

If any future changes to these Terms of Service are unacceptable to you or cause you to no longer be in compliance, you must immediately stop using the Usedesk Service.
